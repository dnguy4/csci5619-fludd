# How to Use FLUDD
1. Press the trigger button on your righthand controller to start aperture selection
2. Move left hand closer to or away from right hand to control radius of flashlight selection
3. Move right hand closer or farther away from your body to select objects closer or farther away than the current selection. Selected objects will be highlighted purple
4. Press the trigger button again to finish aperture selection. If only 1 object was selected, selection is done. Otherwise, progressive refinement begins
5. Press one of the quadrants using the righthand trigger button while pointing at it to select that quadrant.
6. Repeat step 5 until you select a quadrant with only 1 object. Once you select a quadrant with only 1 object, selection finishes.

## Other Controls
You can cancel out of the selection process at any step by pressing the A button. Pressing the B button on the right controller will toggle the spatial tooltips. The left joystick can be used for continuous movement and snap turning.
