# How to Use FLUDD
1. Press the x button on your left-hand controller to start the flashlight selection
2. Move left hand closer to right hand to control radius to control radius of flashlight selection (aperature select)
3. Move right hadn closer or farther away from your body to select objects
4. Selected Objects will be highlighted purple
5. Press the x button again to switch progressive refinement (pulling up QUAD menu)
6. Press one of the quadrants using the right trigger button while pointing at it to select that quadrant

## (DEBUG ISSUE)
The button stays hidden after selecting a quadrant and we weren't exactly sure why. We tried debugging during office hours and it seems to be something to do with the button rather than our code (because we commented out the button function and the issue was still occuring).
