# How to Use FLUDD
1. Press the x button on your left-hand controller to start the flashlight selection
2. Move left hand closer to right hand to control radius to control radius of flashlight selection (aperature select)
3. Move right hadn closer or farther away from your body to select objects
4. Selected Objects will be highlighted purple
5. Press the x button again to switch progressive refinement (pulling up QUAD menu)
6. Press one of the quadrants using the right trigger button while pointing at it to select that quadrant

## Bug
Using the quad menu and trying to select again while the previous object is still grabbed screws with the spherecasting. Was fixed by moving selectionplane out of controller range.
