# How to Use FLUDD
1. Press the A button on your righthand controller to start aperture selection
2. Move left hand closer to or away from right hand to control radius of flashlight selection
3. Move right hand closer or farther away from your body to select objects closer or farther away than the current selection. Selected objects will be highlighted purple
4. Press the A button again to finish aperture selection. If only 1 object was selected, selection is done. Otherwise, progressive refinement begins
5. Press one of the quadrants using the right trigger button while pointing at it to select that quadrant.
6. Repeat step 5 until you select a quadrant with only 1 object. Once you select a quadrant with only 1 object, selection finishes.

You can cancel the quad menu at any time by pressing the A button.

## Bug
Using the quad menu and trying to select again while the previous object is still grabbed screws with the spherecasting. Was fixed by moving selectionplane out of controller range.
